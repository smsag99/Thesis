10.1080/01621459.2020.1736081,Hierarchical Probabilistic Forecasting of Electricity Demand With Smart Meter Data,"Souhaib Ben Taieb, James W. Taylor, Rob Hyndman",Journal of the American Statistical Association,2020,"Abstract Decisions regarding the supply of electricity across a power grid must take into consideration the inherent uncertainty in demand. Optimal decision-making requires probabilistic forecasts for demand in a hierarchy with various levels of aggregation, such as substations, cities, and regions. The forecasts should be coherent in the sense that the forecast of the aggregated series should equal the sum of the forecasts of the corresponding disaggregated series. Coherency is essential, since the allocation of electricity at one level of the hierarchy relies on the appropriate amount being provided from the previous level. We introduce a new probabilistic forecasting method for a large hierarchy based on UK residential smart meter data. We find our method provides coherent and accurate probabilistic forecasts, as a result of an effective forecast combination. Furthermore, by avoiding distributional assumptions, we find that our method captures the variety of distributions in the smart meter hierarchy. Finally, the results confirm that, to ensure coherency in our large-scale hierarchy, it is sufficient to model a set of lower-dimension dependencies, rather than modeling the entire joint distribution of all series in the hierarchy. In achieving coherent and accurate hierarchical probabilistic forecasts, this work contributes to improved decision-making for smart grids.

This hierarchical relation implies one or more aggregate consistency constraints that the series are known to satisfy. Many existing approaches, like for example bottom-up or top-down forecasting, therefore attempt to achieve this goal in a way that guarantees that the forecasts will also be aggregate consistent. We propose to split the problem of HTS into two independent steps: first one comes up with the best possible forecasts for the time series without worrying about aggregate consistency; and then a reconciliation procedure is used to make the forecasts aggregate consistent. We introduce a Game-Theoretically OPtimal (GTOP) reconciliation method, which is guaranteed to only improve any given set of forecasts. This opens up new possibilities for constructing the forecasts. For example, it is not necessary to assume that bottom-level forecasts are unbiased, and aggregate forecasts may be constructed by regressing both on bottom-level forecasts and on other covariates that may only be available at the aggregate level. We illustrate the benefits of our approach both on simulated data and on real electricity consumption data.",f9c8c492-8e98-443d-926c-ee47c2d361c2,77,21,(missing PubMedId),,yes,20

Although some hierarchical forecasting methods like minimum trace are strongly supported both theoretically and empirically for reconciling the base forecasts, there are still circumstances under which they might not produce the most accurate results, being outperformed by other methods. In this paper we propose an approach for dynamically selecting the most appropriate hierarchical forecasting reconciliation method and leading to more accurate coherent forecasts. The approach, which we call conditional hierarchical forecasting, is based on machine learning classification methods that use time series features to select the reconciliation method for each hierarchy. Moreover, it allows the selection to be tailored according to the accuracy measure of preference and the hierarchical level(s) of interest. Our results suggest that conditional hierarchical forecasting can lead to significantly more accurate forecasts than standard approaches, especially at lower hierarchical levels.",5109f7a1-695c-448a-b799-e6378769215b,31,92,(missing PubMedId),,yes,51

In this paper we propose a new approach to hierarchical forecasting which provides optimal forecasts that are better than forecasts produced by either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Our method is based on independently forecasting all series at all levels of the hierarchy and then using a regression model to optimally combine and reconcile these forecasts. The resulting revised forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy, are unbiased and have minimum variance amongst all combination forecasts under some simple assumptions.

Sudoso",Expert systems with applications,2021,"In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for forecasting hierarchical time series. When dealing with hierarchical time series, apart from generating accurate forecasts, one needs to select a suitable method for producing reconciled forecasts. Forecast reconciliation is the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent across the hierarchy. In literature, coherence is often enforced by using a post-processing technique on the base forecasts produced by suitable time series forecasting methods. On the contrary, our idea is to use a deep neural network to directly produce accurate and reconciled forecasts. We exploit the ability of a deep neural network to extract information capturing the structure of the hierarchy. We impose the reconciliation at training time by minimizing a customized loss function. In many practical applications, besides time series data, hierarchical time series include explanatory variables that are beneficial for increasing the forecasting accuracy. Exploiting this further information, our approach links the relationship between time series features extracted at any level of the hierarchy and the explanatory variables into an end-to-end neural network providing accurate and reconciled point forecasts. The effectiveness of the approach is validated on three real-world datasets, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in hierarchical forecasting.",330204e3-a3bb-46ef-9502-e6db23e6180d,79,51,(missing PubMedId),,yes,45

An accurate demand forecast is required at several different levels of a supply chain network to support the planning and decision-making process in various departments. In this paper, we investigate the performance of bottom-up, top-down and optimal combination forecasting approaches in a supply chain. We first evaluate their forecast performance by means of a simulation study and an empirical investigation in a multi-echelon distribution network from a major European brewery company. For the latter, the grouped time series forecasting structure is designed to support managers’ decisions in manufacturing, marketing, finance and logistics. Then, we examine the forecast accuracy of combining forecasts of these approaches. Results reveal that forecast combinations produce forecasts that are more accurate and less biased than individual approaches. Moreover, we develop a model to analyse the association between time series characteristics and the effectiveness of each approach. Results provide insights into the interaction among time series characteristics and the performance of these approaches at the bottom level of the hierarchy.

For example, product sales can come from different cities, districts, or states; or be grouped by categories and subcategories. This hierarchical structure can be useful for improving the forecast, and this strategy is known as hierarchical time series (HTS) analysis. In this work, a novel strategy for sales forecasting is proposed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and hierarchical time series. We formalize three different hierarchical time series approaches: bottom-up SVR, top-down SVR, and middle-out SVR, and use them in a sales forecasting project for the Travel Retail Industry.

However, streamgraph as well as ThemeRiver suffer from scalability problems when dealing with several time series.

Top-down, bottom-up, and optimal linear combination methods are common in hierarchical forecasting. There is no universally optimal solution for hierarchical forecasting, and each method has some advantages and disadvantages. While top-down and bottom-up methods use only the information at the top and bottom levels, respectively, linear combinations use the individual sales forecasts from all series and levels and combine them linearly, often outperforming the conventional top-down and bottom-up methods. These methods do not directly utilise the explanatory information such as price and promotion status that may be available across different levels in the hierarchy, and their performance may be impacted by these external factors. We propose to use a multi-output regression model that utilises the explanatory variables from across hierarchical levels to simultaneously generate forecasts for all the series at the bottom level. We perform an in-depth analysis of 55 sets of fast-moving consumer goods time series and 3049 products of the M5 forecasting competition data.

 Accurate electricity demand forecast plays a key role in sustainable power systems. It enables better decision making in the planning of electricity generation and distribution for many use cases. The electricity demand data can often be represented in a hierarchical structure. For example, the electricity consumption of a whole country could be disaggregated by states, cities, and households. Hierarchical forecasts require not only good prediction accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the consistency between different levels. State-of-the-art hierarchical forecasting methods usually apply adjustments on the individual level forecasts to satisfy the aggregation constraints. However, the high-dimensionality of the unpenalized regression problem and the estimation errors in the high-dimensional error covariance matrix can lead to increased variability in the revised forecasts with poor prediction performance. In order to provide more robustness to estimation errors in the adjustments, we present a new hierarchical forecasting algorithm that computes sparse adjustments while still preserving the aggregation constraints. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional penalized regression, which can be efficiently solved using cyclical coordinate descent methods. We also conduct experiments using a large-scale hierarchical electricity demand data. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art hierarchical forecasting methods, in both the sparsity of the adjustments and the prediction accuracy. The proposed approach to hierarchical forecasting could be useful for energy generation including solar and wind energy, as well as numerous other applications.

Forecasting of hierarchical time series is a challenging and time-consuming problem owing to ensuring the forecasting consistency among the hierarchy levels based on their dimensional features. The excellent empirical performance of our Deep Long Short-Term Memory (DLSTM) approach on various forecasting tasks motivated us to extend it to solve the forecasting problem through hierarchical architectures. Toward this target, we develop the DLSTM model in auto-encoder (AE) fashion and take full advantage of the hierarchical architecture for better time series forecasting. DLSTM-AE works as an alternative approach to traditional and machine learning approaches that have been used to manipulate hierarchical forecasting. However, training a DLSTM in hierarchical architectures requires updating the weight vectors for each LSTM cell, which is time-consuming and requires a large amount of data through several dimensions. Transfer learning can mitigate this problem by training first the time series at the bottom level of the hierarchy using the proposed DLSTM-AE approach. Then, we transfer the learned features to perform synchronous training for the time series of the upper levels of the hierarchy. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, we compare its performance with existing approaches using two case studies related to the energy and tourism domains. An evaluation of all approaches was based on two criteria, namely, the forecasting accuracy and the ability to produce coherent forecasts through through the hierarchy.
